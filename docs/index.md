# Arc Editor

A fast, lightweight, and modal text editor designed for speed, efficiency, and a seamless out-of-the-box experience.

[View Documentation](documentation.html)

## Philosophy

Arc is born from a love of Vim's powerful keybindings and the simplicity of "batteries-included" editors like Helix.

*   **Vim-inspired, simplified:** Arc uses a simple `action -> target` modal editing model. More efficient than Vim's motions without the steep learning curve.
*   **No plugins needed:** Core functionality like a fuzzy finder, Git integration, and themes are (soon-to-be) built-in. No more managing a complex ecosystem of plugins.
*   **Fast and Lightweight:** Written in C, Arc is designed for minimal memory usage and maximum performance.

## Key Features

*   **Modal Editing:** Simple and intuitive `action -> target` keybindings.
*   **Tree-sitter Integration:** Fast and accurate syntax highlighting.
*   **Built-in Git Tools:** Basic integration is planned, starting with displaying the current branch and signs in the gutter.
*   **Fuzzy Finder:** Quickly find and open files.
*   **Theming:** Customize the look and feel of the editor.
*   **LSP Support:** Language Server Protocol support is planned for future development.

## Project Status

**Pre-Alpha:** Arc is currently in the early stages of development. It is usable for some development tasks, but may be unstable and lacks key features like LSP support.
